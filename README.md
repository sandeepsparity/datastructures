JavaScript Data Structures: Singly Linked List [18 exercises with solution]

# Description

`
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear. Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.
